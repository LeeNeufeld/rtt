          What is the process for changing or cancelling an appointment?
        </Row>
        <Row className="d-flex justify-content-center text3 p-3">
          24 hours notice is required to change or cancel an appointment. Life
          happens and we get that, however we also need to be respectful of the
          therapistâ€™s time. Extenuating circumstances exist and can be discussed
          with the therapist. A credit card will be kept on file and charged for
          no-shows and last minute cancellations without just cause.

          Will my benefits cover some of the therapy costs?
        </Row>
        <Row className="d-flex justify-content-center text3 p-3">
          Most benefits and insurance providers will partially cover therapy
          costs until a until a maximum dollar amount per year is reached. Be
          sure to check your benefit plan/member booklet to see what your and/or
          your partners benefits will cover. Only a few insurance providers will
          not cover therapy provided from a Masters Level Social Worker. A
          receipt for service will be provided. Direct deposit for Alberta Blue
          Cross and Green Shield coming soon.

          Do you offer virtual or in-person session?
        </Row>
        <Row className="d-flex justify-content-center text3 p-3">
          Both virtual and in-person sessions are available. There is more
          flexibility around session offerings for virtual sessions. It is
          recommended that Couple, Family and Adolescent Therapy take place in
          person, however this is up to the discretion of the client. We use
          Zoom or Doxy as virtual platforms to keep your information as private
          as possible.

          Demographic and session notes are kept strictly confidential unless
          the following exceptions apply: 1. The therapist has reason to believe
          that a person will imminently harm themselves or others unless other
          parties are involved to mitigate risk; 2. There are any reports of
          child abuse, neglect or endangerment where there are still currently
          children at risk; 3. The therapist receives a legal subpoena to attend
          court and provide information regarding sessions; 4. A Release of

          reason.
