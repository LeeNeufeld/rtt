          past regrettable instances, or issues navigating romance. Couples
          Therapy is also a great way to reconnect with your partner in a
          meaningful way amidst the chaos of everyday life. We practice from a

          Family Therapy Family Therapy is a gateway for better communication,
          understanding and empathy towards the most important people in your
          lives. Often times families struggle to process a change in family
          composition (divorce, separation, addition of new persons) or have
          difficulty navigating the sometimes-turbulent waters of adolescence in
          a way that is respectful for all parties. Family Therapy looks at
          differing attachment styles, parenting styles, struggles for
          independence and parent-child relationship problems. Family Therapy is
          designed to improve the overall functionality of home life and help
          bring joy back into family time.

          Adolescent Therapy Being a teen these days is harder than ever!
          Therapy for tweens/adolescence looks to connect with the young person
          in a way that is respectful and empathetic to the unique challenges
          faced by youth. Therapy sessions are tailored to the youth to help
          them feel comfortable letting their guard down and allowing the
          therapist to venture within the walls of their reality. Therapy can
          assist with depressive thoughts, social and general anxiety,
          impulsivity and reactivity, self-confidence issues, eating troubles
          and difficulty with peers. In-person sessions are recommended for
          better therapeutic alliance.
