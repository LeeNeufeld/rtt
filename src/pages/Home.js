          To ensure we are doing our part to be health conscious while still
          offering excellent service, we are offering both virtual and in-person
          sessions. Cleaning protocols between sessions are being adhered to, as
          is creating social distance and masking. Our intention is to make you
          feel safe, relaxed in comfortable during session.
